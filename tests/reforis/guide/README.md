reForis Guide testing
=====================

These tests go trough reForis Guide in a multiple way. They mainly check reForis
stability and ensure that user's experience with first setup is as good as
possible.

This does not test system itself that much. The other tests should ensure that
configuration set by guide is actually fully functional.
